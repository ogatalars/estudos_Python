# multiple assigment allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code.

# name = "bro"
# age = 32
# attractive = True

# print(name)
# print(age)
# print(attractive)

name, age, attractive = "bro", 32, True

# SpongeBob =30
# Patrick = 30
# Sandy = 30
# Squidward = 30

SpongeBob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30
